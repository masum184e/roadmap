# Express.js Topics for MERN Stack

## 1. Express.js Basics
- Introduction to Express.js
- Setting up an Express server
- Understanding middleware
- Basic routing (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
- Serving static files

## 2. Routing
- Defining routes with `app.get()`, `app.post()`, etc.
- Route parameters and query strings
- Grouping routes using `Router`
- Handling 404 and other errors with custom routes

## 3. Middleware
- Built-in middleware (`express.json()`, `express.urlencoded()`)
- Third-party middleware (e.g., `morgan`, `cors`, `helmet`)
- Custom middleware
- Middleware execution order

## 4. Request and Response Handling
- Accessing request data:
  - `req.body`, `req.params`, `req.query`, `req.headers`
- Sending responses:
  - `res.send()`, `res.json()`, `res.status()`
- Redirecting requests with `res.redirect()`
- Setting headers with `res.set()`

## 5. Template Engines (Optional)
- Integrating template engines like `EJS`, `Pug`, or `Handlebars`
- Rendering HTML templates with dynamic data

## 6. Handling Form Data
- Parsing JSON and URL-encoded form data
- Handling file uploads using `multer`

## 7. RESTful API Development
- Designing RESTful endpoints
- CRUD operations with Express
- Using HTTP status codes effectively
- Structuring routes for scalability

## 8. Authentication and Authorization
- Session management using `express-session`
- Token-based authentication with `JWT`
- Role-based access control
- Securing routes with middleware

## 9. Error Handling
- Creating error-handling middleware
- Catching and responding to errors
- Differentiating between operational and programmer errors

## 10. Integration with MongoDB
- Connecting to MongoDB using Mongoose
- Querying the database in route handlers
- Structuring models and controllers
- Handling database errors gracefully

## 11. Security Best Practices
- Enabling CORS with `cors`
- Preventing common attacks (e.g., XSS, CSRF) using `helmet` and `csurf`
- Sanitizing user inputs
- Securing sensitive data with environment variables (`dotenv`)

## 12. Advanced Features
- Working with WebSockets for real-time communication
- Implementing rate-limiting with `express-rate-limit`
- Using clustering for scaling
- File streaming and downloads

## 13. Testing and Debugging
- Unit testing with frameworks like `Mocha` or `Jest`
- API testing with tools like `Postman` or `Supertest`
- Debugging with built-in Node.js tools or `debug` middleware

## 14. Integration with MERN Stack
- Designing APIs for React frontend
- Handling CORS for React-Express communication
- Building and serving React frontend with Express
- Proxying requests from React to Express in development

## 15. Deployment
- Preparing Express apps for production
- Using `pm2` for process management
- Hosting on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Vercel
- Configuring reverse proxies (e.g., Nginx) for Express

## Tools and Libraries to Explore
- `dotenv` for environment variables
- `cors` for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- `helmet` for security
- `multer` for file uploads
- `jsonwebtoken` for JWT-based authentication
- `mongoose` for MongoDB integration
