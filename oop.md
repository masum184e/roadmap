# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Topics to Learn
## [1. Core OOP Principles (Deep Understanding)](#)

- [Encapsulation (information hiding, invariants)](#)
- [Abstraction (interfaces, contracts, boundaries)](#)
- [Inheritance (when to use vs. composition)](#)
- [Polymorphism (subtyping vs. parametric vs. ad-hoc)](#)
- [SOLID principles (with real-world tradeoffs)](#)

## 2. Object Design & Modeling

- Domain-driven design (entities, value objects, aggregates)
- Rich vs. anemic domain models
- Modeling real-world systems with objects
- Object lifecycle & state transitions
- Avoiding “god objects” and tight coupling

## 3. Design Patterns (Not Just Names — Usage & Tradeoffs)

Creational

- Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Singleton (and why to avoid it)

Structural

- Adapter, Decorator, Composite, Facade, Proxy

Behavioral

- Strategy, Observer, Command, State, Template Method, Visitor, Mediator

Know:

- When not to use a pattern
- How patterns emerge naturally from good design

## 4. Composition Over Inheritance

- Favoring composition
- Role-based composition
- Delegation vs. inheritance
- Mixins / traits (language-specific)

## 5. Interfaces, APIs & Contracts

- Interface segregation
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) in practice
- Designing stable public APIs
- Backward compatibility strategies
- Versioning object models

## 6. Dependency Management

- Dependency inversion principle (DIP)
- Constructor vs. setter vs. method injection
- Dependency injection frameworks (Spring, Guice, .NET DI, etc.)
- Avoiding service locator anti-pattern

## [7. Object-Oriented Architecture](#)

- [Layered architecture](#)
- [Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)](#)
- [Clean Architecture](#)
- [Onion architecture](#)
- [How OOP fits into microservices & modular monoliths](#)

## 8. Error Handling & Robustness

- Exception hierarchies
- Checked vs. unchecked exceptions (language-specific)
- Fail-fast vs. graceful degradation
- Designing recoverable vs. unrecoverable errors

## 9. Testing Object-Oriented Systems

- Unit testing objects in isolation
- Mocking vs. fakes vs. stubs
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Designing testable objects
- Testing polymorphic behavior

## 10. Performance & Memory Considerations

- Object allocation costs
- Garbage collection impact
- Object pooling (when justified)
- Immutability vs. mutability
- Value objects vs. reference objects

## 11. Concurrency & OOP

- Thread safety in object design
- Immutable objects
- Synchronization strategies
- Actor model vs. shared state
- Designing concurrent-safe APIs

## 12. Refactoring & Legacy Code

- Refactoring object hierarchies
- Breaking large classes safely
- Replacing inheritance with delegation
- Eliminating code smells (e.g., feature envy, shotgun surgery)

## 13. Language-Specific Mastery (Pick Your Stack)

- Java: JVM memory model, equals/hashCode, serialization, streams
- C#: value vs. reference types, async/await, immutability
- Python: duck typing, multiple inheritance, dataclasses
- C++: RAII, rule of 5, smart pointers
- Kotlin/Swift: data classes, sealed classes, value types

## 14. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- God object
- Anemic domain model
- Tight coupling
- Inheritance abuse
- Over-engineering
- Premature abstraction

## 15. Communication & Leadership in OOP

- Explaining design decisions
- Mentoring juniors on design
- Leading design reviews
- Balancing purity vs. pragmatism
