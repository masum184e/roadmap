| **1 (Sep)** | Set up core REST APIs: Users, Workspaces, Projects, Tasks. Integrate MySQL/Postgres + Prisma, MongoDB for activity logs. Implement basic CRUD + Postman tests. |
| **2 (Oct)** | Add authentication & authorization (JWT, OAuth2, Sessions), event-driven notifications, and messaging (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for async tasks like email. Add unit & integration testing. |
| **3 (Nov)** | Dockerize services, setup CI/CD pipelines, deploy to local Kubernetes cluster, integrate monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana, ELK/Loki). |
| **4 (Dec)** | Refactor into microservices (Users, Tasks, Notifications), optimize queries, caching with Redis, scaling, load balancing, high availability. |
| **5 (Jan)** | Cloud deployment on AWS/GCP/Azure, serverless integrations (Lambda/S3), final performance optimization, observability, and prepare production-ready demo & documentation. |

## Stretch Goals / Advanced Features
- Real-time WebSocket updates for task assignment / comments.  
- Multi-tenant design (each team/workspace isolated).  
- Analytics dashboard for managers (tasks completed, overdue, active users).  
- Audit logging of user actions with Kafka streams.  
- File storage with S3 + processing via Lambda (e.g., image compression, PDF generation).

**Outcome:**  
By the end of this project, you will have a **fully functional, production-ready SaaS backend** that demonstrates mastery of **TypeScript, Node.js, Databases, Security, Event-Driven Architecture, Messaging, CI/CD, Docker/K8s, Cloud Deployment, Monitoring, and Observability**. This is a **capstone project** suitable for your portfolio or interviews.
