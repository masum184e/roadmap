# Node.js Topics for MERN Stack

## 1. Node.js Basics
- What is Node.js and its event-driven architecture
- Installing Node.js and using Node REPL
- Global objects (`__dirname`, `__filename`, `process`, `console`)
- Using Node.js modules (`require`, `module.exports`)

## 2. Core Modules
- **File System**: Reading, writing, and manipulating files (`fs`)
- **Path**: Working with file and directory paths (`path`)
- **HTTP**: Creating basic HTTP servers and handling requests (`http`)
- **Events**: EventEmitter and custom events (`events`)
- **Stream**: Reading and writing streams (`stream`)
- **OS**: Accessing system information (`os`)

## 3. Package Management with npm
- Installing and managing packages with npm
- Using `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- Understanding dependencies (`dependencies` vs. `devDependencies`)
- Semantic Versioning and updating packages
- Creating and publishing custom npm packages

## 4. Asynchronous Programming
- Callbacks, Promises, and `async/await`
- Error handling in asynchronous operations
- Using `util.promisify` for callback-based APIs
- Working with the `Promise.all` method

## 5. Working with APIs
- Sending HTTP requests using `http`, `https`, or libraries like `axios` or `node-fetch`
- Consuming REST APIs
- Parsing and handling JSON data

## 6. Building a Web Server
- Creating a simple HTTP server
- Handling requests and responses
- Serving static files manually or with libraries (e.g., `serve-static`)

## 7. Express.js Integration
- Setting up an Express app as the framework for backend
- Middleware concepts
- Routing and API design
- Error handling in Express

## 8. File Handling
- Reading and writing files (`fs.readFile`, `fs.writeFile`)
- Working with file streams for large files
- Handling file uploads (e.g., `multer`)

## 9. Working with Databases
- Connecting to MongoDB using the native MongoDB driver or Mongoose
- Performing CRUD operations
- Handling database connections and errors

## 10. Authentication and Authorization
- Implementing token-based authentication with JWT
- Hashing passwords using `bcrypt`
- Session management and cookies
- Role-based access control

## 11. Real-time Communication
- Using `WebSocket` for real-time communication
- Working with `Socket.IO` for features like chat apps or live updates

## 12. Streams and Buffers
- Understanding streams (`Readable`, `Writable`, `Duplex`, `Transform`)
- Reading and writing large files using streams
- Working with Buffers for binary data

## 13. Security Best Practices
- Preventing common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)
- Securing sensitive data using environment variables (`dotenv`)
- Protecting APIs with rate limiting and CORS
- Validating user input to prevent malicious data

## 14. Unit Testing and Debugging
- Writing tests with frameworks like `Mocha`, `Jest`, or `Chai`
- Mocking and stubbing with `Sinon.js`
- Debugging using Node.js debugger or VS Code
- Writing end-to-end tests for APIs with `Supertest`

## 15. Node.js Deployment
- Preparing Node.js apps for production
- Using `pm2` for process management
- Deploying Node.js apps on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean
- Setting up reverse proxies with Nginx
- Configuring environment variables for production

## 16. Performance Optimization
- Using clustering to utilize multi-core processors
- Understanding and using the Event Loop effectively
- Optimizing database queries and caching results
- Profiling and monitoring Node.js applications

## 17. Integration with MERN Stack
- Connecting Node.js backend to MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- Designing RESTful APIs for React frontend
- Handling CORS for cross-origin requests
- Proxying requests from React to Node.js in development

## Tools and Libraries to Explore
- `dotenv` for environment variables
- `nodemon` for development automation
- `axios` or `node-fetch` for HTTP requests
- `jsonwebtoken` for JWT-based authentication
- `bcrypt` for password hashing
- `socket.io` for real-time communication
- `express` for web frameworks
- `mongoose` for MongoDB integration
