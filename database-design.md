- Denormalization (when and why)

## 5. Advanced Database Design
- Weak vs. Strong entities
- Generalization, Specialization, Inheritance
- Aggregation
- Recursive relationships
- Many-to-Many relationship resolution
- Indexes and performance considerations

## 6. Physical Database Design
- Mapping ERD to relational schema
- Choosing data types
- Defining indexes
- Partitioning and sharding basics

## 7. Transactions and Integrity
- ACID properties
- Referential integrity
- Cascading updates/deletes
- Transaction management and concurrency control

## 8. Security and Access Control
- User roles and privileges
- Data encryption basics
- SQL injection prevention in design
